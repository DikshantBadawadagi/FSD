## üéØ Core Functionality Breakdown

1. **Authentication**  
   - Implemented via **JWT** for secure session management.  
   - Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt**.  
   - Enables user registration and login functionality.  

2. **Real-Time Messaging**  
   - Built with **Socket.io** to enable WebSocket connections.  
   - Sends messages in real-time between users.  
   - Depicts **online status** and **typing indicators** when a user is active and typing.  
   - Chat messages are stored persistently in **MongoDB**, allowing users to view past conversations.  

3. **User Posts**  
   - Users can create posts, which other users can like and comment on.  
   - Includes a **real-time notification system**:  
     - Notifies users when their post is liked or commented on.  

4. **User Status Updates**  
   - Utilizes WebSockets to broadcast status changes (online/offline) to all connected users.  

5. **User Profile Management**  
   - Users can set up and customize their **profile**.  
   - Includes options to update **profile bio** and other personal information.  

6. **Frontend User Experience**  
   - **React Context** manages user authentication and application state.  
   - Auto-scroll ensures the latest messages are always visible in the chat window.  
   - Minimalist, intuitive UI for effortless navigation and interaction.
