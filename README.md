## üéØ Core Functionality Breakdown

1. **Authentication**  
   - Implemented via **JWT** for secure session management.  
   - Passwords are securely hashed using **bcrypt**.  
   - Enables user registration and login functionality.  

2. **Real-Time Messaging**  
   - Built with **Socket.io** to enable WebSocket connections.  
   - Sends messages in real-time between users.  
   - Depicts **online status** and **typing indicators** when a user is active and typing.  
   - Chat messages are stored persistently in **MongoDB**, allowing users to view past conversations.  

3. **User Posts**  
   - Users can create posts, which other users can like and comment on.  
   - Includes a **real-time notification system**:  
     - Notifies users when their post is liked or commented on.  

4. **User Status Updates**
